This project builds a model from a dataset of accepted loan applications from the Lending Club from 2007-2020.

Lending Club is a peer to peer lending platform that connects investors to borrowers.
It provides borrowers with unsecured personal loans ranging from $1,000 to $40,000
with a standard loan term of 36 months.

Investors have adopted P2P lending as an alternative investment instrument to achieve
returns from interest paid by borrowers against the principal borrowed from the
investor.

Lending Club uses their own proprietary algorithms, fed by a number of predictive
features regarding the loan applicant, to approve loans and segment them into various
risk grades and sub-grades. Investors can review the loan applications on the
platform, and make decisions based on the risk analysis provided by Lending Club, or
by using their own strategies.

This project aims to define a strategy that outperforms the one employed by Lending
Club.
