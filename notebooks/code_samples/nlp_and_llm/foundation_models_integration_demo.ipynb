    "\n",
    "This notebook guides model developers through the process of using a large language model (LLM) specialized in sentiment analysis for financial news. It shows you how to set up the ValidMind Developer Framework, initializes the client library, and uses a specific prompt template for analyzing the sentiment of sentences in a dataset. The notebook also includes example data to test the model's ability to correctly identify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.\n"

    "ValidMind's platform enables organizations to identify, document, and manage model risks for all types of models, including AI/ML models, LLMs, and statistical models. As a model developer, you use the ValidMind Developer Framework to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind AI Risk Platform UI to collaborate on documentation projects. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",
